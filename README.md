# Wikipedia Laravel Package

A powerful, developer-friendly Laravel package for accessing Wikipediaâ€™s vast knowledge graph. This package bridges the gap between your Laravel application and structured/unstructured content on Wikipedia. Whether you're building educational tools, integrating intelligent search, or enriching content with real-time knowledge, this package gives you full programmatic access to article text, infoboxes, images, and metadataâ€”across multiple languages.

No more dealing with raw API calls! With this package, you can use a fluent interface, full Laravel Facade support, and smart query enhancements to get exactly the data you want.

## Features

- Retrieve full article content in HTML, plain text, or summary.
- Fully customizable multi-language support (e.g., English, Persian, French, etc.).
- Smart search and suggestions.
- Extract categories, infobox data, and article images.
- Full support for Facades and Interface-based implementation.


## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.0
- Laravel >= 9.x


## Installation

```bash
composer require denason/wikipedia
```

## Usage Examples

You can use the global `wiki()` helper or dependency injection with the interface to access all features.

### 1. Get article summary
```php
$summary = wiki()->summary('Albert Einstein');
echo $summary;
```
**Output:**
> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.

### 2. Get full HTML content
```php
$html = wiki()->html('Python (programming language)');
```

### 3. Get plain text content
```php
$text = wiki()->text('Tehran');
```

### 4. Search with suggestions
```php
$results = wiki()->smart()->search('Newton');
```

### 5. Get article image
```php
$image = wiki()->imageUrl('Nikola Tesla');
```

### 6. Get categories
```php
$categories = wiki()->categories('Photosynthesis');
```
- Don't forget to use return to see the output.

### 7. Get infobox data
```php
 $infobox = wiki()->infoBox('iran');
 foreach ($infobox as $key => $info)
{
    echo $key. '=' . $info;
}
```

### 8. Get description (Wikidata)
```php
$desc = wiki()->description('Black hole');
echo $desc;
```
**Output:**
> region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing â€” not even light â€” can escape

### 9. Use getInfo for advanced API call
```php
$data = wiki()->getInfo('Mars', 'extracts', 'json', ['exintro' => true, 'explaintext' => true]);
retutn $data;
```
**Output:**
> Array of raw data based on specified parameters.

### 10. Use extract for custom property
```php
$extract = wiki()->extract('Iran', 'extracts', ['explaintext' => true]);
return $extract;
```
**Output:**
> Iran, also called Persia, is a country in Western Asia.

## Available Methods

All methods are accessible via the `wiki()` helper or through dependency injection using the `WikipediaInterface`.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `summary(title, extra)` | Returns a short summary of the article. |
| `html(title)` | Retrieves the full article content in HTML. |
| `text(title)` | Retrieves the full article content as plain text. |
| `search(query)` | Performs a search for related article titles. |
| `suggest(query)` | Returns search autocomplete suggestions. |
| `smart()` | Enables smart suggestion-based search. If a keyword isn't found, it will return the most relevant alternative suggestion automatically. |
| `lang(code)` | Sets the query language (e.g., 'fa', 'en'). Use this when working with non-English titles. For example, for Persian: `wiki()->lang('fa')->summary('Ø¯Ù†Ø§');` |
| `categories(title)` | Returns article categories as an array. |
| `imageUrl(title)` | Returns the thumbnail image URL of the article. |
| `url(title)` | Returns the full URL to the article. |
| `raw(title)` | Returns the raw JSON data from Wikipedia API. |
| `infoBox(title)` | Extracts structured data from the articleâ€™s infobox. |
| `description(term)` | Returns the Wikidata description of the term. |
| `extract(title, prop, extra)` | Custom extract call from Wikipedia API. |
| `getInfo(title, prop, format, extra)` | General method for accessing Wikipedia API with advanced parameters. |

ðŸ“Œ How to :

### Dependency Injection Example

Instead of using the global `wiki()` helper, you can inject the `WikipediaInterface` directly into your controller, service, or job. This is especially useful when writing testable and decoupled code.

#### Example: Using WikipediaInterface in a Controller

```php
use Denason\Wikipedia\WikipediaInterface;

class ArticleController extends Controller
{
    public function show(WikipediaInterface $wiki)
    {
        $summary = $wiki->summary('Iran');

        return view('article.show', compact('summary'));
    }
}
```

This approach takes advantage of Laravel's service container to resolve the interface to its concrete implementation automatically.

-It also fully supports the Facades
